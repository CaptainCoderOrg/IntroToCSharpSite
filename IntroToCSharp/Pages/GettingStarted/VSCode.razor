    <Text>
        Modern software is incredibly complex. In fact, it could be argued that
        modern software is one of the most intricate and complex thing humans
        have ever created. A typical software engineer must know a large number
        of tools that help them. In order to manage this complexity, programmers
        utilize a development environment.

        In this section, we will discuss how to set up a <b>C#</b> development
        environment using <b>Visual Studio Code</b> as well as discuss the reasons
        this book uses it over other options. For most of this book, it will be
        referred to as <b>VS Code</b> to avoid confusion with another tool
        called <b>Visual Studio</b>.
    </Text>
    <Note>
        There is nothing stopping you from using any development tools
        that you want. If you're already up and running with Visual Studio,
        Rider, or any other tool chain, feel free to skip this section.

<Section Title="Why VS Code?">
    <Text>
        <b>VS Code</b> is a lightweight but powerful source code editor editor
        that runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. It is free, has a large active
        development community, and provides an easy tool chain to allow
        developers to write custom extensions.

    <Text><b>Why not Visual Studio or Rider?</b></Text>
    <Text>
        I am often asked why I don't use <b>Visual Studio</b> (Windows) or
        <b>Rider</b> (Mac) to develop <b>C#</b> code. The short answer is that
        I have and I do use <b>Visual Studio</b> when I am developing large
        projects. It is a very powerful tool designed specifically for working
        with <b>.NET</b> and is excellent for productivity. However,
        because it is so well designed, these tools hide many of the nitty
        gritty details that I feel are important to learn and understand
        when you're starting out as a developer.

        With <b>VS Code</b> you will not only learn how to code in <b>C#</b>
        but you will also learn and practice the soft skills associated
        with being a software developer.

        This section assumes you already have the .NET SDK installed. If you
        have not done so already, install .NET SDK and then continue.

    <Note>
        This document was last updated on Jan. 22nd 2024. As of its writing, .NET 8 was
        the latest version of the .NET SDK.

        Next, you will install the "Polyglot Notebooks" extension. This extension allows you to
        quickly write and test code without creating an entire <b>C#</b> project. This can be incredibly useful
        for testing out small snippets of code like the ones scattered throughout this book.
