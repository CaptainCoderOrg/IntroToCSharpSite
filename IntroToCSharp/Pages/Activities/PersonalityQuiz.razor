                Sent by King Andor, you delve deep into the dungeon of Raylock
                in search of the stolen Chalice of Nu. You encounter a locked
                door. What do you do? Do you use your mighty strength to kick
                the door down? Do you use your years of academy training to cast
                a spell that allows you to move through wood? Or do you use your
                rogues kit to pick the lock?

            Before starting to program, it is important to think about the possible
            outcomes that your user can receive. Start with 4 outcomes (you may
            add more after completing the activity).
        </Text>
        <Text>
            For example, if you were creating a quiz titled "Which Dungeons and
            Dragon's Class Are You?", you might include these 4 outcomes: Fighter,
            Wizard, Rogue, and Bard.
        </Text>
        <Text>
            Or, if you were creating a quiz titled "Which Marvel Super Hero Are
            You?" you might include these 4 outcomes: Thor, Black Widow, She Hulk,
            and Iron Man.

            Now that you know the possible outcomes of your quiz, you must design your questions
            to reflect the possible choices. For now, keep it simple by having 4 possible answers
            for each question. Each possible answer will be associated with one of your outcomes.

                    holding civilians captive! How do you respond?

                    1. Use the power of Thunder to scare them away.
                    2. Covertly sneak into the bank to asses the situation.
                    3. This makes me angry... they won't like me when I'm angry.

            The answers to your question do not need to be in the same order
            as your possible outcomes. In fact, doing so might make your quiz
            less interesting.

            Next, add in a question that is slightly more complex. In this
            question, each response might be associated with more than one of the
            outcomes. For example:
        </Text>
        <Output>
            On the battle field, where do you stand?

            1. Up close to my enemies, I can't use a blade from away
            2. Behind my beefy friends, my specialty is combat from afar
        </Output>
        <Text>
            In the above example, the first option will increase both the
            Figher, and Rogue score while the second option will increase
            the Wizard and Bard score.

            You are most like Black Widow! You prefer to user your covert training to
