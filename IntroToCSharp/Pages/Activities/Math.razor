<Section Title="Introduction">
    <MudText>At the heart of all computers and computer programs is math. Most modern-day computers are cable of doing
        math on an extremely large-scale,
        but today we are going to learn about how to interpret and implement basic arithmetic within our own programs. A
        math <Keyword Word="operation"></Keyword> is made up of <Keyword Word="operators"></Keyword> and <Keyword
            Word="operands"></Keyword>. Now, let's learn how to make our computers do math for us!</MudText>
</Section>

<Section Title="Basic Math Operators">
    <MudText>In C#, you treat math operations like you would in real life! Addition is "+", subtraction is "-",
        multiplication is "*", division is "/", and the only operator that may be unfamiliar is remainder (also known as
        mod
        "%"). Mod allows the user to get the remainder of a division operation. Below are some examples!
    </MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/AddSubExample.cs" />
    <MudDivider Class="mt-6 mb-6" DividerType="DividerType.FullWidth"></MudDivider>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/MultiplicationExample.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of j?"
        Explanation="20 is the correct answer because 5 multiplied by 4 is 20!">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="25" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="9" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="20" IsCorrect="true" />
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
    <MudText Class="mt-6"></MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/Division.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of a?"
        Explanation="The answer is 10 because 100 divided by 10 is 10!">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="90" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="10" IsCorrect="true" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1/10" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1000" IsCorrect="false" />
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
    <MudText Class="mt-6"></MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/Mod1.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of c?"
        Explanation="Remember that the percent symbol indicates we want the remainder of the numbers. 
    That means it will act as a division sign, but give the remainder. 7 goes into 50 7 times (49), so the remainder would be 1!">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1" IsCorrect="true" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="7" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="0" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="50" IsCorrect="false" />
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
    <Note>Let's do one more remainder question to get you used to the operation!</Note>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/Mod2.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of b?"
        Explanation="The correct answer is 3 because 6 can only go into 63 ten full times before going over! 6 * 10 is 60 so the remainder is 3!">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="7" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="10.5" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="3" IsCorrect="true" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="60" IsCorrect="false" />
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
</Section>

<Section Title="Indicating Signs">
    <MudText>
        You can use the addition and subtraction signs to indicate if a number or variable is positve or negative!
    </MudText>
    <Example>
        You can say that 5 is postive through the expression +5. If you want it to be negative, then it is -5! The same
        applies for
        variables that have been declared!
    </Example>

</Section>
<Section Title="The Order of Operations">
    <MudText>The order of operations in C# works just like it does in the real math world. Hopefully you remember
        P.E.M.D.A.S., but if not, multiplication and divison(or mod) go before addition and subtraction and the
        operation is evaluated left to right.</MudText>
    <MudText Class="pt-4">Let's try a basic example!</MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/OrderOfOperations1.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of a?"
        Explanation="Following the order of operations we would do the following: 1. 4 / 1 = 4     2. 4 * 2 = 8      3. 4 + 8 = 12 ">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="6" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="12" IsCorrect="true"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="4" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
    <MudText Class="pt-4">Unfortunately, it's not always that easy. C# and many other programming languages give us the
        option to alter the order of operations using parentheses. At first this may feel confusing but it gives us
        extreme versatility when designing math operations for our program.</MudText>

    <MudText Class="pt-4">Let's look at the same example from above but this time I put parentheses to change the order
        of operations!</MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/OrderOfOperationsWithParentheses.cs" />
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of b?"
        Explanation="Because of the parentheses we must do complete the operations (4 + 4) and (1 * 2) first. Then we do the final operation of (8 / 2) as a result to get 4 as our answer.">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="6" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="12" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="4" IsCorrect="true"></CheckBoxOption>
        <CheckBoxOption Text="1" IsCorrect="false"></CheckBoxOption>
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>

</Section>
<Section Title="Compound Assignment Operators">
    <MudText> Compound assignment operators are a combination of an operator and an equal sign! These act as shortcuts
        that change a variable
        by using a math operation.
    </MudText>
    <Example Title="Compounding operators">
        Instead of saying (j = j + 9;), you can change a variable by saying (j +=9;) The same applies for the other
        operators.
    </Example>
    <MudText Class="pa-4">Let's try an example!</MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/PlusEquals.cs"></CodeBlock>
    <MultipleChoiceQuestion IsMultiSelect="true" Question="What is the value of j?"
        Explanation="10 is the correct answer because the variable j is initially declared as 6, but is changed to 10 because 6 + 4 = 10">
        <CheckBoxOption Text="10" IsCorrect="true" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="6" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="4" IsCorrect="false" />
        <CheckBoxOption Text="2" IsCorrect="false" />
    </MultipleChoiceQuestion>
</Section>
<Section Title="More about Division">
    <MudText>When dividing one integer by another integer(a.k.a. "integer divison") the remainder of the operation is
        ignored. Here's an example!</MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/IntegerDivision.cs" ReplIt="cwarren5701/IntegerDivision" />
    <MudText>We know that 50 / 7 would be 7 with a remainder of 1 but integer division ignores that remainder.</MudText>
    <MudText Class="pt-4">Now, let's see what happens when we divide two floating-point numbers.</MudText>
    <CodeBlock Filename="Math/DoubleDivision.cs" ReplIt="cwarren5701/DoubleDivision" />
    <Questions Title="Use your knowledge!">
        <Message></Message>
        <ChildContent>
            <Question Text="What's the difference between integer and floating-point division?">
            </Question>
        </ChildContent>
    </Questions>
    <ExplanationPanel>As we see in the example, double division results in an more exact number without ignoring the
        remainder.</ExplanationPanel>
    <Note>Just like in the real math world, you cannot divide by zero!</Note>

</Section>

<Section Title="Other Math Operators">
    <MudText>In addition to the normal operators, you can use "Abs" for the absolute value, "Pow" and "Sqrt" for the
        power and square root of a number,
        and the trig functions "Sin", "Cos", and "Tan"! </MudText>
    <Note>You will not use these very often, but they may be useful in certain situations!</Note>
