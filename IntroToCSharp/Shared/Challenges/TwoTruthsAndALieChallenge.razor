        Two Truths and a Lie is a game in which you test how well your
        peers know you. You start by thinking of two things about yourself that
        are true and a third thing that is not true. Then, you say those three
        things to your peers in any order. Finally, your peers try to guess
        which of the items is a lie.

        In this challenge, you will write a program that displays three
        facts about yourself. Two of the facts will be true and the third
        is a lie. Next, your program prompts the user to guess which
        of the facts is a lie. Depending on the choice they make, the
        program will display a different outcome.

    <Text>Before starting, think about what your program will display:</Text>
    <Question DBName="WelcomeMessage" Text="What will your program display as a welcome message?"/>
    <Question DBName="Fact1" Text="What will your first fact be?"/>
    <Question DBName="Option1" Text="What will your program display if the user selects this option?"/>
    <Question DBName="Fact2" Text="What will your second fact be?"/>
    <Question DBName="Option2" Text="What will your program display if the user selects this option?"/>
    <Question DBName="Fact3" Text="What will your third fact be?"/>
    <Question DBName="Option3" Text="What will your program display if the user selects this option?"/>
    <Question DBName="InvalidOption" Text="What will your program display if the user selects an invalid option?"/>
    <Text>Now that you've thought through your program, implement it.</Text>
