            <Text>
                When you divide by zero with a <b>floating-point</b> number, the
                program does not crash. Instead, the division results in the
                value <Code>double.PositiveInfinity</Code> or
                <Code>double.NegativeInfinity</Code>. This behaviour might seem
                odd but it is a result of the computer attempting to divide by
                an infinitely small number.
