    <Explore Title="Illegal Casting">
        <Text>
            When you use <b>cast</b> between types, you are telling the computer
            to treat the <b>value</b> as though it were the specified
            <b>type</b>. This only works if the <b>value</b> is compatible with
            the new <b>type</b>. For numeric types, this works well. But, what
            happens if you try to <b>cast</b> with non-numeric types?
