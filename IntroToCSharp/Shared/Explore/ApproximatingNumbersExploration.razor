                The code above demonstrates a <Keyword Word="rounding error"/>. This is
                an error that occurs when a decimal value cannot be precisely represented
                by the number of <Keyword Word="bits"/> being used. When writing a
                program that uses <Code>doubles</Code>, it is important to consider if
                it is okay for the precision to be approximated. For example,
                an approximation of a race cars speed in a video game is probably okay.
                However, approximating the amount of money a person earns in banking
                software could cause problems.
