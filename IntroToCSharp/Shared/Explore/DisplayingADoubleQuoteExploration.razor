    <Question Text="What is the error message you receive?"/>
    <Explanation>
        <Text>
            The error message you're seeing is the computer stating that it
            cannot find the end of a string. When it encounters the second
            <Code>"</Code> it believes that you have end the string.

    </Explanation>
    <Text>
        Because the double quote is used to signify the end of a <b>string</b>, we need a way to
        indicate that we would like to include that character within a <b>string literal</b>. To
        do this, we use an <Keyword Word="escape sequence"/>: <Code>\"</Code>.

        An <b>escape sequence</b> is a special code used within a <b>string literal</b> to indicate
        that we would like to use a character that would otherwise be considered illegal. In C#, <b>Escape
        sequences</b> always start with a backslash (<Code>\</Code>). Because of this, there is an
        <b>escape sequence</b> for the backslash character: two back slashes (<Code>\\</Code>).
